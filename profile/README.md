# YEDU Taxi

**Premium ride-hailing platform for the UAE, built with a product-first and AI-assisted approach.**

YEDU Taxi is not just a taxi service. It is a carefully designed mobility experience that combines speed, personalization, safety, and intelligent assistance through EVA — our AI concierge.

## 🌍 What is YEDU Taxi

YEDU Taxi is a next-generation ride service focused on:

* Fast and predictable car delivery
* Personalization based on user needs, not just car classes
* Premium UX inspired by UAE standards
* AI-assisted interaction (EVA)
* High emphasis on safety, trust, and clarity

The platform is designed to scale from MVP to a full ecosystem including subscriptions, business rides, concierge scenarios, and smart fleet interaction.

## 🧩 Platform Structure

The project is split into independent components, each maintained in its own repository:

* **Backend** — core business logic, pricing, trips, EVA orchestration, integrations
* **Admin Panel** — internal management tools (operations, analytics, control)
* **Mobile App** — iOS / Android client application

This separation allows clean ownership, independent releases, and scalable team growth.

## 🤖 EVA — AI Concierge

EVA is a core part of the product, not a chatbot add-on.

EVA acts as:

* User assistant before, during, and after trips
* Communication bridge between user and driver
* Business concierge for premium users
* Guided interface to complex actions (planning, changes, support)

All sensitive actions are protected by backend-controlled security logic.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

* Private repositories
* Strict access control via GitHub Teams
* No secrets stored in repositories
* Environment-based configuration (DEV / STAGE / PROD)
* Audit-ready process (Enterprise setup)

Security is treated as a product feature, not a technical afterthought.

---

## 👥 Organization & Ownership

* This organization is managed under **GitHub Enterprise**
* Access is granted per-team and per-repository
* Each repository has clear ownership and review responsibility

**Team Lead:** Halil Gayypov

## 🛠 Development Principles

* Pull-request–only workflow
* Protected `main` branch
* Code reviews required
* Clear separation of concerns
* Product-driven decisions over feature clutter

We prefer clarity over speed, and correctness over shortcuts.
